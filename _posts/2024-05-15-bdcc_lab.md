This project aims to understand the distribution of published works in terms of different categories and factors in [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/). OpenAlex is an open source platform that contains different forms of published works ranging from research literature to different academic journals in different institution all over the world. With this dataset, our goal is to understand the trends and patterns that we may garnered specifically in different fields such as:

- Author and Institution analysis: By analyzing the different constribution made by the authors and institutions we may identify the profile of the leading researchers and institutions.
- Categorical Distribution: understanding the different distribution of published works in different fields and domain.
- Temporal Trends: We examine the evolution of published wokrs over the years. This could in the form of number of publication per year, common use words per year, and so on.
- Citation and Score impact: We examine the number of citation and primary_score made by OpenAlex. With this we may know which among institutions annd authors has a significant contribution in their respective field.

**Conclusion**<br>
The analysis that we have done with the OpenAlex datset had presents us different key findings and patterns across the various fields:

**Most published work is in the Medicine field**<br>
Among the 26 fields, Medicine had dominated all others with the most published works. This may be expected, since medicine is most likely driven by the global health challenges and continuous support from many industries as medicine is a key part of a us. However despite having the most published work, the mean score for this field is not the best. The Medicine Field had ranked 14th out of 26 which is, which shows also shows that there are a lot of published works that are not above average score.

**Author with the most published work: A9999999999**<br>
Based from the different results this author id gave us the most published works, however by looking at the OpenAlex website this author id is not showing any author at all, which made us beleived that this author id are hidden authors, they are not null values rather they just don't want to be recognize

**Improving mean score**<br>
Another interestining finding that we got is that overtime there is really an improvement of mean score, which means that there is an improvement of quality of published works. Moreover when number of citation had peaked between 2000-2020 the mean score of those years were the highest as well.

**Consistency in keywords**<br>
The keywords that we got from the different wordcloud that we created (year 2000, 2020, and 2021) had showed us that there is a consistency of the most common words used in their title, this suggests that there is a persitent focus on investigative and evaluative research across the fields/domains, moreover such consistency also indicates an stable approach on framing research studies.

**Citation and Author Productivity** <br>
Another interesting finding is that, not all authors with the most published work had the highest amount of citation. There is this author with 3 published works only yet garnered the highest number of citation. This indicates that there is a gap between the quality of the published work between the authors.

**Institutional Domain Expertise** <br>
One of the great highlights, is that different institutions exhibits a domain expertise, which means that some instiution performed well on a specific doman while performing worst on the other. This finding also tell us how these institutions allocate their resources.
